<h1>Welcome to CI demo!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, all servers to compose a CI system <br/>
 is successfully installed and working.</p>

<p>This CI system consists of the following servers<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/gerrit">Gerrit</a>
 works as a web based code review and Git version control system.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/jenkins">Jenkins CI</a>
 works as an automatic building and testing server which is the core component of the CI system.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/redmine">Redmine</a>
 works as a web based issues and tasks tracking system.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/nexus">Sonatype Nexus</a>
 works as a local Maven repository.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Gerrit and Redmine share the same LDAP authentication system which is specified in the config file.
So you are able to use the same username and password to log in those systems.
</p>
<p>
A DEMO project is pre-imported into
<a href="/gerrit/#/admin/projects/">Gerrit</a>
, <a href="/jenkins/job/demo/">Jenkins</a>
and <a href="/redmine/projects/demo">Redmine</a>
to demonstrate how to connect these systems together.
Feel free to play around with this project. The whole system can be destroyed or
recreated by the destroyContainer.sh or the recreate.sh.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in administrating these servers, the default credentials of super user
are listed as below.<br/>
Gerrit: admin/passwd<br/>
Redmine: admin/admin<br/>
Nexus: admin/admin123<br/>
